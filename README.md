🚖 Travel & Transportation Analytics – Capstone Project
🎯 Objective

The project explores the use of Big Data Analytics in the Travel and Transportation industry to improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability through data-driven insights.

🧩 Use Cases & Problem Statements
1️⃣ Ride-Demand Forecasting

Problem Statement:
Unpredictable ride demand often leads to either an excess of idle drivers or unfulfilled customer requests during peak hours. The challenge is to forecast ride demand across different zones and time periods to ensure an optimal balance between driver availability and customer demand.

2️⃣ Dynamic Pricing Optimization

Problem Statement:
Ride-hailing platforms face difficulty in maintaining fair pricing during demand surges while ensuring profitability. The goal is to analyze surge-pricing patterns and develop strategies that dynamically adjust fares based on demand, time, and location to maximize revenue without compromising customer satisfaction.

3️⃣ Route Efficiency Analysis

Problem Statement:
Inefficient routing increases fuel costs, travel time, and driver fatigue. The problem is to identify the most efficient and profitable routes by analyzing trip distance, duration, fare amount, and traffic patterns to optimize both customer experience and driver performance.

4️⃣ Driver Utilization Insights

Problem Statement:
Driver productivity and utilization vary widely due to uneven demand distribution and scheduling inefficiencies. The objective is to analyze driver utilization patterns to align driver deployment with predicted demand, reducing idle time and improving operational efficiency.

5️⃣ Customer Segmentation

Problem Statement:
Not all customers exhibit the same travel frequency or spending behavior. The task is to segment customers into distinct groups based on ride frequency, average fare, and travel patterns, enabling targeted promotions, loyalty programs, and personalized service offerings.
